            <h2>About ME?</h2>
            <p>Hi! I’m a recent graduate with a bachelor's degree in software engineering. I created this companion app for Magic: The Gathering (MTG) because I love the game but often find myself forgetting my dice and struggling to keep track of my deck lists when friends ask. This app is my solution to those challenges, helping players like me enjoy the game without the hassle. I’m excited to share the app with you. If you enjoy the app and would like to support my work, consider donating through the "Buy Me A Coffee" button. Thank you for being a part of this journey! :) <3",
            </p>
